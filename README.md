# ChromeExtension
Front-end for the summarizer extension

This is a simple Chrome extension to summarize long text using OpenAI's API. Built mainly to learn how OAuth works.

How to use:
1. Download the repository as a .zip archive
2. Extract it anywhere
3. Open Chrome
4. Open chrome://extensions/
5. Enable Developer Mode
6. Select "Load Unpacked" and navigate to the extracted folder


If your Chrome browser is connected to a Google account and Sync is enabled, you can log in through the button in the Extension pop-up. If not, clicking that button will open the log-in page hosted on the Server.
